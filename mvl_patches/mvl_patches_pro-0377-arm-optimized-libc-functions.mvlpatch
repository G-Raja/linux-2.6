    [ARM] 3049/1: More optimized libgcc functions
    
    Patch from Nicolas Pitre
    
    This patch gets rid of the last C implementations of needed libgcc
    functions for the kernel, replacing them with optimized assembly
    versions.
    
    Those functions are:
    
    __ashldi3
    __ashrdi3
    __lshrdi3
    __muldi3
    __ucmpdi2
    
    The first 3 were lifted from gcc, the other two were written from scratch.
