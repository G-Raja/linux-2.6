# Patch: -ppc32_rt_remap_kmap_atomic_functions
# Date: Wed Apr 26 12:00:50 2006
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc. 
# MR: 15170 
# Type: Defect Fix 
# Disposition: submitted to Ingo Molnar 
# Signed-off-by: Daniel Walker <dwalker@mvista.com>
# Description:
# 
# 	Another vital bit to the PPC port that was missed . In RT preempt disable is
# mostly removed because we add mutexs in for spinlocks. In this case, kmap_atomic()
# turns off preemption for a very significant portion of code. Inside these code
# blocks it's inevitable that we will lock a spinlock converted to a mutex. 
# 
# This patch re-works kmap_atomic and friends to call their non-atomic 
# sibling's.

Description:

	Another vital bit to the PPC port that was missed . In RT preempt disable is
mostly removed because we add mutexs in for spinlocks. In this case, kmap_atomic()
turns off preemption for a very significant portion of code. Inside these code
blocks it's inevitable that we will lock a spinlock converted to a mutex. 

This patch re-works kmap_atomic and friends to call their non-atomic 
sibling's.
