# Patch: -common_kgdb_cross_hang
# Date: Wed Jul 26 21:43:18 2006
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc.
# MR: 18258
# Type: Defect Fix
# Disposition: needs submitting to LKML
# Signed-off-by: Ruslan V. Sushko <rsushko@ru.mvista.com>
# Description:
# 	This patch fixes issues with KGDB rebooting during debugging. The
# problem is the spin_unlock macro. This macro is combination of unlocking
# functionality (_raw_spin_unlock) and task switching via preempt_schedule
# function (when CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_PREEMPT are switched on). So when
# the user sets a breakpoint in preempt_schedule or this function is reached
# during step-by-step debugging, the kgdb handler goes into an infinite loop.
# The solution is to use a spinlock that does not do scheduling functions
# in kgdb code that is used while debugging.
