#     [PATCH] ppc32: Allow adjust of pfn offset in pte
#     
#     Allow the pfn to be offset by more than just PAGE_SHIFT in the pte.  Today,
#     PAGE_SHIFT tends to allow us to have 12-bits of flags in the pte.  In the
#     future if we have a larger pte we can allocate more bits for flags by
#     offsetting the pfn even further.
