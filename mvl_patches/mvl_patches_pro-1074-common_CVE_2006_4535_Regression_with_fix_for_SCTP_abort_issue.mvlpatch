# Patch: -common_CVE_2006_4535_Regression_with_fix_for_SCTP_abort_issue
# Date: Fri Feb 16 09:10:06 2007
# Source: http://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=204460
# MR: 20096 
# Type: Security Fix 
# Disposition: backport
# Signed-off-by: Armin Kuster <AKuster@mvista.com>
# Description:
# With the recent fix, the callers of sctp_primitive_ABORT() need to create an
# ABORT chunk and pass it as an argument rather than msghdr that was passed
# earlier.
# 
# This is a regression with bug 202122 (CVE-2006-3745
# 
# The regression causes a panic if an SCTP socket has SO_LINGER set with a linger
# value of 0 and it is closed.

Description:
With the recent fix, the callers of sctp_primitive_ABORT() need to create an
ABORT chunk and pass it as an argument rather than msghdr that was passed
earlier.

This is a regression with bug 202122 (CVE-2006-3745

The regression causes a panic if an SCTP socket has SO_LINGER set with a linger
value of 0 and it is closed.
