#   [ARM] Fix slab corruption issues triggered with pud_t integration.
#   
#   When the page tables are wrapped from 4 levels to 2 levels, the new
#   MM code requires PMD_SHIFT to match PUD_SHIFT, which must also
#   match PGDIR_SHIFT.  If PMD_SHIFT is smaller than PUD_SHIFT, we risk
#   freeing a still-in-use table (== page) which can then get re-used
#   for the slab cache.
#   
#   Testing and inspection shows that there isn't any real benefit from
#   keeping PMD_SHIFT set to 20.
#   
#   In addition, add some comments concerning the granularity of
#   alloc_init_section() and fix a missing PMD assignment in the
#   rebooting code.  Somehow we managed to get away with that, although
#   it is actually wrong.  Maybe I've just been lucky until now.
