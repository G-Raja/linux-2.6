# Patch: -common_fix_kgdb_smp_hang
# Date: Wed Dec 28 14:57:33 2005
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc.
# MR: 13517
# Type: Defect Fix
# Disposition: needs submitting to kgdb maintainer
# Signed-off-by: Corey Minyard <cminyard@mvista.com
# Description:
#     kgdb had a number of problems dealing with SMP systems.
# 
#     The first was that the E1000 driver wasn't using the proper
#     mechanisms to enable and disable interrupts in netpoll, and
#     was calling the main interrupt routine to handle polling,
#     which has bad interactions if NAPI was turned on.
# 
#     Second, when single stepping, due to interrupt interactions,
#     it was possible to blow the stack on the other processors
#     while single-stepping a lot.  Adding a small delay after
#     letting the other processors go fixes the problem.
#     I guess it's a big hacky, but I commented the heck of out it.
# 
#     Third, there was an extraneous, uncommented udelay in
#     a memory copy routine.  It didn't seem to serve any useful
#     purpose (and there was no comment) so I removed it.
