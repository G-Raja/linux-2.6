# Patch: -frd_specify_major_device_number
# Date: Tue Mar 21 08:30:59 2006
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc.
# MR: 16702
# Type: Integration
# Disposition: MontaVista 
# Description:
# The /dev/preempt_dev device is used to stream preemption latency data to
# userspace. This device is currently declared as a misc device, 
# and the major device ID is dynamically assigned.
# In order to reliably inter-operate with tools such as DevRocket, 
# as well as other demo code, the preempt-dev needs to be statically assigned.
# This patch assigns the major 244 to character device preempt_dev
#
