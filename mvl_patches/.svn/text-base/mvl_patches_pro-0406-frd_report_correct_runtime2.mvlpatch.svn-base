# MR: 14679
# Type: Bug Fix
# Disposition: MontaVista
# Signed-off-by: Sven-Thorsten Dietrich <sven@mvista.com>
# Description:
# At high frequencies, the FRD numbers can be compromised by the call to
# gettimeofday made from FRD[0].
# 
# The start time is better obtained by the thread
# calling module_init, therefore avoiding any locking
# issues around xtime lock encountered by FRD[0]
# 
# This patch moves the call to gettimeofday to the module loader's context.

Description:
At high frequencies, the FRD numbers can be compromised by the call to
gettimeofday made from FRD[0].

The start time is better obtained by the thread
calling module_init, therefore avoiding any locking
issues around xtime lock encountered by FRD[0]

This patch moves the call to gettimeofday to the module loader's context.
