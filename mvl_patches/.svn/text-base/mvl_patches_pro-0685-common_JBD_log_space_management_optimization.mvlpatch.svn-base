#     [PATCH] JBD: log space management optimization
#     
#     during truncate ext3 calls journal_forget() for freed blocks, but before
#     these blocks go to the transaction and jbd reserves space in log for them
#     (->t_outstanding_credits).  also, journal_forget() removes these blocks
#     from the transaction, but doesn't correct log space reservation.  for
#     example, removal of 500MB file reserves 136 blocks, but only 10 blocks go
#     to the log.  a commit is expensive and correct reservation allows us to
#     avoid needless commits.  here is the patch.  tested on UP.
