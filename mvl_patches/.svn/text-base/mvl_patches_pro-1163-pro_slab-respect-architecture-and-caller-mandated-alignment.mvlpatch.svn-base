#     [PATCH] slab: respect architecture and caller mandated alignment
#     
#     As explained by Heiko, on s390 (32-bit) ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is set to
#     eight because their common I/O layer allocates data structures that need to
#     have an eight byte alignment.  This does not work when CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG is
#     enabled because kmem_cache_create will override alignment to BYTES_PER_WORD
#     which is four.
#     
#     So change kmem_cache_create to ensure cache alignment is always at minimum
#     what the architecture or caller mandates even if slab debugging is enabled.

    [PATCH] slab: respect architecture and caller mandated alignment
    
    As explained by Heiko, on s390 (32-bit) ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN is set to
    eight because their common I/O layer allocates data structures that need to
    have an eight byte alignment.  This does not work when CONFIG_SLAB_DEBUG is
    enabled because kmem_cache_create will override alignment to BYTES_PER_WORD
    which is four.
    
    So change kmem_cache_create to ensure cache alignment is always at minimum
    what the architecture or caller mandates even if slab debugging is enabled.
