# Patch: -ppc_xilinx_ps2_lockup_fix
# Date: Mon Mar  6 15:04:07 2006
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc.
# MR: 17015
# Type: Defect Fix
# Disposition: needs submitting to linuxppc-embedded mailing list
# Signed-off-by: Andrei Konovalov <akonovalov@ru.mvista.com>
# Description:
#     The patch fixes the lock-up inside sxps2_write() when nothing
#     is connected to the PS/2 port or the connected peripheral is
#     not operational.
#     Another fix is to use separate copies of SERIO_* flags for each
#     port, not the (shared) static variable.
