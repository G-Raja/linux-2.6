# Patch: -pro_ppc7xx_ibm750fxgx_serial_fix
# Date: Wed Dec 28 15:04:09 2005
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc.
# MR: 15130
# Type: Defect Fix
# Disposition: MontaVista
# Signed-off-by: Mark A. Greer <mgreer@mvista.com>
# Description:
#     A recent patch to the serial_core code
#     (linus/2.6.13-rc2/pro_fix-console-spinlock-init.patch) has changed how
#     the port->lock spin_lock get initialized in the 8250/serial driver.
#     This has introduced a bug such that the spin_lock can be used without
#     being initialized.
# 
#     This happens when the platform file sets UPF_IOREMAP in the port's flag
#     field.  When that flag is set, port->membase is left at zero--the chestnut
#     memory maps its uart regs--causing serial8250_console_setup() to exit
#     early with -ENODEV (it exits early because both port->iobase &
#     port->membase are zero).  Because of this early exit, port->lock is not
#     initialized and hence its use without being initialized.
# 
#     This is a real bug that needs to be fixed in the 8250 driver.  In the
#     meantime, this patch makes the chestnut/ibm_750fxgx manually ioremap
#     its uart's registers removing the need to set UPF_IOREMAP and,
#     therefore, avoiding this bug.
# 
#     Note that the chestnut/ibm_750fxgx is the only ppc platform that uses
#     UPF_IOREMAP so the other ppc platforms should be okay.
