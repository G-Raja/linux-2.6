# 
# This patch started life as as534, and has been re-diffed against the latest

# 
# usb-storage has a small loophole, a window between the time queuecommand
# accepts a new command and the time the control thread starts to execute
# it.  If disconnect is called during that window, the driver won't cancel
# the pending command -- we've been relying on the SCSI core to cancel it
# for us during host removal.  But it's better for usb-storage to cancel
# it;  this avoids races and reduces reliance on the SCSI core.
# Fortunately cancelling these commands is easy to do; the key is to do it
# _before_ calling scsi_remove_host.

Subject: [PATCH] [PATCH] USB Storage: close a race condition in disconnect near queuecommand

This patch started life as as534, and has been re-diffed against the latest
tree.

usb-storage has a small loophole, a window between the time queuecommand
accepts a new command and the time the control thread starts to execute
it.  If disconnect is called during that window, the driver won't cancel
the pending command -- we've been relying on the SCSI core to cancel it
for us during host removal.  But it's better for usb-storage to cancel
it;  this avoids races and reduces reliance on the SCSI core.
Fortunately cancelling these commands is easy to do; the key is to do it
_before_ calling scsi_remove_host.
