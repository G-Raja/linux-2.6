# Patch: -pro_ppc32_pq2_reboot
# Date: Tue Aug  8 21:02:01 2006
# Source: Freescale Semiconductor, Inc.
# MR: 18374
# Type: Defect Fix
# Disposition: needs submitting to linuxppc-embedded@ozlabs.org
# Signed-off-by: Wade Farnsworth <wfarnsworth@mvista.com>
# Description:
#     On the PQ2ADS boards (e.g. PQ2FADS, 8272ADS) there is no real mechanism
#     for doing a reboot in software.  Currently, the workaround is to branch
#     to the start of U-boot.  However, this will cause a panic in certain
#     situations.  Instead what we can do is set a bit to cause a hard reset
#     when the core enters a checkstop state, then force a checkstop.
