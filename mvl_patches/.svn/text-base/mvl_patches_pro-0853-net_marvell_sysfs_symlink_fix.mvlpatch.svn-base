The SET_NETDEV_DEV has to be done before a call to register_netdev.  With
the new patch below, the device symlink for the platform device was
created.  Unfortunately, after the 4 ls commands, the network connection
died.  No idea if the box crashed or if something else broke, lost remote
access.

Provide sysfs 'device' in /class/net/ethN Also, set module owner field,
like pcnet32 driver does.
