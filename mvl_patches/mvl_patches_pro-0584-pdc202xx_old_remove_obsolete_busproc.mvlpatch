# Patch: -pdc202xx_old_remove_obsolete_busproc
# Date: Fri May 26 10:18:30 2006
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc.
# MR: 17419
# Type: Defect Fix
# Disposition: accepted into 2.6.17-rc4-mm1
# Signed-off-by: Sergei Shtylyov <sshtylyov@ru.mvista.com>
# Signed-off-by: Andrew Morton <akpm@osdl.org>
# Description:
# 
# Remove the busproc from pdc202xx_old.c because:
# 
# - it handles the obsolete HDIO_TRISTATE_HWIF ioctl instead of the modern
#   HDIO_SET_BUSSTATE, so treats its argument wrong;
# 
# - I don't think that tristating both channels is good idea (probably can't
#   be done otherwise since there seems to be only single bit controlling this).
