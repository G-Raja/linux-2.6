# Date: Wed Dec 28 14:58:05 2005
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc. George Anzinger <george@mvista.com>
# MR: 14232
# Type: Defect Fix 
# Disposition:  needs submitting to sourceforge/ RT patch
# Signed-off-by: George Anzinger <george@mvista.com>
# Description:
#     Arch cycles were being computed for low res timers.  This caused 
#     them to be late by up to a jiffie.
# 
#     Low res timers are rounded up to the resolution.  By computing 
#     an arch cycle offset for them we are adding additional time that 
#     is already accounted for in the resolution round up.
# 
#     This patch clears the arch cycle part of the timer for timers that
#     are low res.

Description:
    Arch cycles were being computed for low res timers.  This caused 
    them to be late by up to a jiffie.

    Low res timers are rounded up to the resolution.  By computing 
    an arch cycle offset for them we are adding additional time that 
    is already accounted for in the resolution round up.

    This patch clears the arch cycle part of the timer for timers that
    are low res.
