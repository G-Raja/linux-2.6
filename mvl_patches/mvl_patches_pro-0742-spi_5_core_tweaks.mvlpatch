# [PATCH] SPI core tweaks, bugfix
# 
# This includes various updates to the SPI core:
# 
#   - Fixes a driver model refcount bug in spi_unregister_master() paths.
# 
#   - The spi_master structures now have wrappers which help keep drivers
#     from needing class-level get/put for device data or for refcounts.
# 
#   - Check for a few setup errors that would cause oopsing later.
# 
#   - Docs say more about memory management.  Highlights the use of DMA-safe
#     i/o buffers, and zero-initializing spi_message and such metadata.
# 
#   - Provide a simple alloc/free for spi_message and its spi_transfer;
#     this is only one of the possible memory management policies.
# 
# Nothing to break code that already works.

+Note that there are two types of memory your driver must manage as part
+of interacting with SPI devices.
+
+  - I/O buffers use the usual Linux rules, and must be DMA-safe.
+    You'd normally allocate them from the heap or free page pool.
+    Don't use the stack, or anything that's declared "static".
+
+  - The spi_message and spi_transfer metadata used to glue those
+    I/O buffers into a group of protocol transactions.  These can
+    be allocated anywhere it's convenient, including as part of
+    other allocate-once driver data structures.  Zero-init these.
+
+If you like, spi_message_alloc() and spi_message_free() convenience
+routines are available to allocate and zero-initialize an spi_message
+with several transfers.
