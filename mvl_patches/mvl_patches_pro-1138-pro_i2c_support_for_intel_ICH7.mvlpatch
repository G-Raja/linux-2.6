# [PATCH] I2C support for Intel ICH7 - 2.6.10 - resubmit
# 
# This patch adds the Intel ICH7 DID to the i2c-i801.c driver and adds an
# entry to Kconfig for I2C(SMBus) support.  Note: This patch relies on the
# already submitted and accepted PATA patch to pci_ids.h containing all
# ICH7 DID's.

[PATCH] I2C support for Intel ICH7 - 2.6.10 - resubmit

This patch adds the Intel ICH7 DID to the i2c-i801.c driver and adds an
entry to Kconfig for I2C(SMBus) support.  Note: This patch relies on the
already submitted and accepted PATA patch to pci_ids.h containing all
ICH7 DID's.
