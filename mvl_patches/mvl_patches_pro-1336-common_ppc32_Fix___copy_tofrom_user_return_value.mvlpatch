# Subject: [PATCH] [PATCH] ppc32: Fix __copy_tofrom_user return value
# 
# Recently the __copy_tofrom_user routine was modified to avoid doing
# prefetches past the end of the source array.  However, in doing so we
# introduced a bug in that it now returns the wrong value for the number
# of bytes not copied when a fault is encountered.  This fixes it to
# return the correct number.
