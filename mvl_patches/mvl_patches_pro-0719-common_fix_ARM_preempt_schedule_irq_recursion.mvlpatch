# Patch: -common_fix_ARM_preempt_schedule_irq_recursion
# Date: Thu Jun 29 13:50:40 2006
# Source: MontaVista Software, Inc.
# MR: 17703
# Type: Defect Fix
# Disposition: MontaVista
# Signed-off-by: George G. Davis <gdavis@mvista.com>
# Signed-off-by: Daniel Walker <dwalker@mvista.com>
# Description:
# When preempt_schedule_irq() is called on exit from the interrupt handler,
# there is a race condition in __schedule() after preempt_enable_no_resched()
# where a second interrupt results in preempt_schedule_irq() recursion on
# architectures such as ARM which must enable interrupts during
# context_switch() because preempt_count() is already reset to zero and
# interrupts are reenabled in prepare_arch_switch().  If an interrupt occurs
# during this window, it results in preempt_schedule_irq() recursion leading
# to stack overflow and/or task state corruption.  To resolve this issue,
# local_irq_disable() is added to the ARM finish_arch_switch() macro to
# insure that interrupts are disabled prior to preempt_enable_no_resched()
# at the end of __schedule().  This allows interrupts to occur during
# context_switch() to minimise interrupt latency during any required
# cache/TLB flushing while also insuring that interrupts are disabled prior
# to preempt_enable_no_resched() thus insuring that preempt_schedule_irq()
# recursion is no longer possible.
