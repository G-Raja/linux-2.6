# [MIPS] Au1xx0: really set KSEG0 to uncached on reboot
#     
# Fix a really old buglet in AMD Au1xx0 restart code: instead of
# modifying the whole CP0 Config.K0 field to 010b (meaning KSEG0 uncached)
# before flushing the caches and resetting a board, it only sets bit 1 of that
# reg. which is effectively a NOP since Config.K0 == 011b as the kernel sets it
# up (which is also its default value for Au1xx0).
